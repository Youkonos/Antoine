schedules should start no earlier than 610

NPCs walk slowly, allow them around 2 hours per map they need to cross. To walk from Marnie's ranch to the Adventurer's Guild takes about 3-4 hours.

There are three maps that are out of bounds to NPCs: The backwoods, the secret woods, and the farm. If you include any of these areas in the NPC's schedule, they will simply refuse to move.

Some places are extremely popular for NPCs to stand: In the middle of the end of the jetties, in front of Mona's graveâ€¦ Stalk your NPC.
