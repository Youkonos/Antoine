The numbers correspond to the frame on the sprite sheet. and they go in: pre-animation/looping animation/post-animation. Pre and post are generally identical, only mirror imaged.

The speed is predetermined (I think around 120 ms) so you will need to repeat the same frame multiple times to avoid having them move very fast.
